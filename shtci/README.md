Simil-kinetic sheath internal-ion-energy transmission coefficient:

- More theoretical details in the introduction of shtci_kin.F
- Activated by setting 'b2stbc_bceni_03_style' switch in b2mn.dat to '1'
- Diagnosed by setting 'b2stbc_diagno' switch in b2mn.dat to '2'

Current assumptions:

- Pure hydrogenic plasma (no impurities)
- Unitary adiabatic coefficient in computing sound speed (GAMMAI = 1)
